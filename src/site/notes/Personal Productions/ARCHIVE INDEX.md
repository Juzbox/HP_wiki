Welcome! Here is a collection of notes, projects, and contacts I am slowly developing into a browsable archive. This is done by me [Hugo Pilate](hugopilate.com), and with support from the [Cyberlocal Strategies community](https://discord.gg/VtDufxdX).

If this archive is of use to you, please consider donating to my [Kofi page](https://ko-fi.com/U6U0G3B13).
